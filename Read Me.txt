I have created an email signature in HTML which can be simply pasted into the signature field for gmail.

Gmail has its limitations when it comes to custom signatures and doesn't allow many freedoms of design compared to outlook or other email clients

The html document uses websafe fonts which should consistently translate across mobile and other clients

Instructions:

Logos, Social Media Icons and Footer Image must be replaced with your hosted Images
before Use...This should be a 1 time step, Do not use images hosted on google drive. Recommend hosting files on company word press site. If these options are missing First enable development options within your browser 

1. Right click .html file and open in your preferred browser
2. Right click page and choose “inspect” make sure you are on element tab or (ctrl+shift+I) to inspect
3. Click Drop Down Icons ? to expand <body></body> tag
4. Expand all ?  tags or (ctrl+shift+f) to search within html file
Search “img” or “src=”
change URL within src=” ” commas to appropriate hosted image asset
Example <img src=”URL” 
5. Once all social media, Logos, footer elements are changed refresh page
if images are missing please ensure correct url was added or images are made public with host service
6. Right click page and save as HTML only 
7. Open created HTML file then ctrl+a to select page
8. Open GMAIL Settings? general tab? scroll down to Signature Section

The Signature (names & Number & emai) can be updated within the text area field, please click “change” to edit hyperlinks...Additional instructions can be found inside the html file itself. 

Editing Document with a word processor is not recommended but for windows users Note Pad can be used. Right click html file and select open with Notepad. Ctrl F can be used to search for ? src=” ” 
Each section has been labeled for ease of use
